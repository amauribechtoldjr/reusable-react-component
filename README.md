# SigmaMD - Front-end Challenge

We're very pleased to see that you have reached this stage of the recruitment process.

This test has been designed in three parts in which we'll evaluate different aspects of your knowledge.

Take your time with the exercises; this is your opportunity to showcase your skills and knowledge.

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with someone involved in the recruitment process.

## Exercises

Each exercise comes with its description as well as the intended objective. 

There is no right or wrong answer; feel free to suggest different rules and behaviors.

Remember, you have complete autonomy and freedom to choose the tools and libraries that will support you in solving the exercises.

### Introduction

As engineers, we value the creation of components that can be easily reused in the future.

For the exercises, imagine that you have been tasked with developing a registration flow for new doctors of the SigmaMD platform. The design team has prepared a handoff available in `/materials.`

### Exercise 1

Upon reviewing the new screens and flows, you notice that there's a new step-by-step component that hasn't been implemented in the project's component library. Therefore, the objective of this challenge is to implement it.

#### Objective

Identify the component, its visual and behavioral characteristics, and implement it considering the evaluation criteria.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Componentization, Logic, Developer Experience, Patterns, Best Practices, Accessibility


### Exercise 2

Now that the step-by-step component has been implemented in the previous exercise, your goal is to implement the signup flow from the handoff.

Some files were pre-created to facilitate the exercise, they are under the `/materials` folder. Feel free to use them as references in your implementation.

#### Objective

Structure a front-end project containing a signup flow using the created components and interacting with asynchronous APIs.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Project Structure, Refactoring, State Management, Quality, Testing, Error Handling

### Exercise 3

Currently, SigmaMD (https://www.sigmamd.com/) uses a NoCode platform for creating the brand's website.

Considering that in the future, we might have an internal engineering team taking over this project and that you could be responsible for outlining the ideal architecture. Provide a proposal outlining your decision-making process and the evaluation of necessary characteristics for the chosen tools and technologies, given the nature of the project.

Feel free to make hypotheses if necessary.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Theoretical Knowledge, Architecture, Technologies

## Deliverable

Feel free to organize the exercises the way you think is better. 

When you finished tell the person involved in your recruiting process.

A technical conversation will be scheduled in which you will present the solved exercises and discuss your technical experiences.

## Extras

If you have any projects, articles, or blog posts that you believe would help us get to know you better, you can share them here.

## Feedback

Let us know what you thought of the exercises and if you had any questions during development. Feel free to share your thoughts!
